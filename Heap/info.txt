Video name: Heap - Heap Sort - Heapify - Priority Queues

If node is at index "i"
its left index is at 2 * i
its right index is at 2 * i + 1
its parent is at floor(i/2)

Note: [ index is given, not the actual value. 
Index starting from 1. For theory puproses.]

Maximum number of nodes = 2 ^ (h + 1)
where h is height

Height of a "complete" binary tree = log(n)

Complete Binary tree: if you fill an array from left
to right. there should not be any gaps.

Important: Heap is a complete binary tree
Max Heap: root is the Max (and a complete binary tree)
Min heap: root is the Min (and a complete binary tree)


insert: adjustment upwards (leaf towards root)
delete: adjustment downwards (root towards leaf)
Time complexity: O(log(n))
Only root element is deleted
